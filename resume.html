		<p class="p1" style="text-align: center; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #339966;"><strong>In the Mood for Love</strong> by Wong Kar-Wai</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px; padding-right: 90px;text-align: left;">I absolutely love the costumes: the director uses the changes in Su&rsquo;s costume to directly represent her changes in emotions. In the beginning of the film, she is wearing a bright dress which makes her brim with happiness. After she finds out about the affair, the flowery patterns on her dresses disappear, her dresses become so dark which almost blend into the shadow in the staircase, showing how lonely, depressed and painful she is. The bright colours and pleasing patterns come back when Chow and Su fall in love, the bright red coat she wears when she goes to the hotel, both represent how much she likes Chow. Finally when she decides to leave with Chow, she wears a green dress, showing how much she is looking forward to a new life with him. Over 25 costumes on Su take the audiences, like me, to an emotional roller coaster throughout the film.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px; padding-right: 90px;text-align: left;">Music, I need to talk about music and how it is used in this movie to shape the interactions between Chow and Su. The best example is&nbsp;Yumeji's Theme by Shigeru Umebayashi; This cello concerto in G-minor appears repetitively throughout the entire movie. As any other classical waltz, there is a lingering main melody with a tender rhythm; which is consistent with everything moving in slowmotion on the screen. Audiences then pay more attention to see this love relationship evolving just like Chow and Su are dancing a alluring, romantic waltz. There is another cello playing on top of it which gives a much stronger rhythm in contrast to the underlying melody. This adds a layer of compulsion and complexity to the story-telling,&nbsp;so when learning about how Chow and Su get closer, audiences are also constantly being&nbsp;reminded by the music that there is always a lingering tension between them which stops the affair from happening.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px; padding-right: 90px;text-align: left;">There are some extremely short cuts combining with several long takes to show the inner struggle of Chow and Su. When Chow invites Su to the hotel, there is a long shot directly on Chow&rsquo;s face- he has no facial expressions at all. While audiences start to doubt if the movie has paused, a sudden knock on the door finally replaced his poker face into a smile. Comparing to the series of short cuts of Su running back and forth in the hotel debating if she should go find him, the super long Chow&rsquo;s silent scene first enhances audiences&rsquo; expectations and imagination. This contrast not only makes audiences directly feel Su&rsquo;s struggle, but also understand Chow&rsquo;s desire and expectations. He isn&rsquo;t waiting for her by himself, the entire theatre is waiting with him for her to knock on the door.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px; padding-right: 90px;text-align: left;">The closure is very interesting: He uses a very special way to end this movie, comparing to the fancy music and colors before, the ending part shot in Angkor Wat is very different in style. Chow has buried his secret for so long, all of the feelings he has for her, all thicken as time passes. In order to show the idea of time and hopelessness, putting in closure in a place with extremely long history such as Angkor Wat, is such a wise choice. The only blurry video tape cut he put in this movie is the documentary of the time when French president Charles de Gaulle visited Cambodia; that is the signature event which marked the end of colonial rule in Cambodia. He used the end of this old era as a metaphor indicating that everything from that era will no longer exists, including the Chow&rsquo;s love for Su.</p>
		<p class="p1" style="text-align: center; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #339966;"><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Downfall</strong> by Oliver Hirschbiegel</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 90px; padding-right: 90px;"><span class="s1">I feel like the story is majorly told from Traudl&rsquo;s and Peter&rsquo;s <strong>perspectives</strong>. Switching between two points of view creates omniscience for me and also change my moods while watching the film. Inside of Hitler&rsquo;s bunker, the story is told mainly from Traudl&rsquo;s perspective. Through her eyes, s can see Hitler from a more human side, and how the leaders of Germany change from bing confident and calm in the beginning to suiciding in the end. While her perspective tells the story in a life-to-death order, the movie uses Peter&rsquo;s perspective to tell the story in a death-to-life manner. After seeing the transition of this little kid from being brave and willing to fight for Hitler, to coming home after realizing how much losses this war has brought to Germany, I can regain the confidence in those survived Germans and hope for a brighter future.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 90px; padding-right: 90px;"><span class="s1">The <strong>props</strong> used in this film are so important in portraying characters&rsquo; emotions such as their strong hope. When the ladies go for a walk in the nature between attacks, there are narcissus flowers in full bloom as Traudl looks down on the ground. Narcissus here means rebirth for Germany because it can endure the toughest winter and bloom when spring comes. Another example is Frederick the Great&rsquo;s portrait that Hitler is staring at in his room. This Prussian Emperor was going to suicide when he thought Russia would certainly win; but the Empress Elizabeth of Russia suddenly died and the new emperor admired Frederick so much that he stopped all attacks towards Prussia.In the movie similar situation has occurred- Germany is on the edge of losing but Roosevelt just died, I can directly feel how much Hitler hopes for the same miracle to happen again.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 90px; padding-right: 90px;"><span class="s1">Hirschbiegel uses non-diegetic <strong>sounds</strong> to enhance the emotions expressed in this film. In the scene that Eva and Magda are writing their last letters, even though director also show the cuts of explosion, burning documents and surgery, all of the diegetic sounds have been taken away from them. Instead, s can only hear the interlaced voices of Eva and Magda&rsquo;s reading their letters, Eva&rsquo;s typing sound and the extremely sad background music-<em>Eva Brauns letzter Brief</em>. Even though the ladies sound so calm, the string orchestra in the background adds a thick layer of hopelessness and sorrow to their words and also to every cut viewers are watching. Here the director wisely switches the role of images and sounds- s can use what they see on the screen to help interpret what Eva and Magda are saying, and to directly feel their despair.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 90px; padding-right: 90px;"><span class="s1">In order to achieve smooth transition and invisible editing, Hirschbiegel sutures over cuts through sound by using lots of <strong>sound bridges</strong> in this film. When Goebbels children first arrived at the bunker bedroom, the smallest one started to sing the first sentence of the song then the image turns into all of them singing the rest of the song in front of Hitler in another room. Without this continuity editing skill, the two cuts should be really hard to be connected naturally because there are both temporal and spatial differences in between, but this sound bridge makes the transition unnoticeable by me while still remaining the same moods from the previous scene to the following scene.</span></p>
